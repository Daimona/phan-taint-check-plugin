This is a plugin to Phan to try and detect security issues
(such as XSS)

This is still experimental and very rough around the edges.

If you want to use it add either GenericSecurityCheckPlugin.php
or MediaWikiSecurityCheckPlugin.php to the plugins list in
your phan config, depending on if you are checking a non-mediawiki
project or a MediaWiki/MediaWiki extension respectively.

This is only tested with Phan 0.8.0

== Environment variables ==
The following environment variables affect the plugin:
* SECURITY_CHECK_EXT_PATH - Path to extension.json when in MediaWiki mode. If not set assumes the project root directory.
* SECCHECK_DEBUG - File to output extra debug information (If running from shell, /dev/stderr is convenient)
